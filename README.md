## INTRODUCTION

**What is history?**

There are many different definitions of history, concerned both with the past and the present. I define history as a network of narratives about the past that shape and are shaped by our understanding of the present. There is not a singular, authoritative history of the world. History is a network of interpretations, omittances, emphases and representations that make up collective and individual memories about the past. Benjamin Walter suggests that changes in the ways by which we understand the world happen because it “is determined not only by nature but by historical circumstances as well” (1968, p. 5). The ways by which and how we understand history is shaped by our values, our lived experiences, and global and cultural context. The way we understand history changes over time because of the emergence of new ideas and theories, and new experiences. Claudio Fogu, for example, compares ancient concepts of history as a “reservoir of moral lessons” to the modern Western concept of history as a linear and progressive timeline of human actions (2009, p. 109).  How we understand the past is contingent on how we understand the present. The concept of an objective and factual history is an illusion. 

**What does it mean to digitize history?**

Digitization draws history into the digital world by creating new representations of and narratives about history using digital tools. Digitization allows people to use new tools to analyze and represent history. The digitization of history allows for a new and more creative exploration into how history can be represented. 

This portfolio will analyze how digitizing history changes how we understand history through my work in the course *Critical Making in Digital History* taught by Professor Shawn Graham. Throughout this course, I worked on four projects that centered around the ambiguous historical figure Joseph Brant. For these projects, I translated a historical artefact into the digital world, remixed that digital translation of the artefact, represented that history in a virtual game format, and brought the historical narrative back into the physical world. Throughout this course, I explored the different narratives about Brant that could be created through the use of technology. Digitization can preserve, subvert, represent and overshadow history. 

**Who is Joseph Brant?**

Joseph Brant (1742-1807) was a Mohawk warrior and statesman (Sugden 1996). Brant, born Thayendanegea, was given the name Joseph when he was baptized in an Anglican church as a child. He supported the British during the American Revolution. He fought for land and land rights in what is now Canada for the Iroquois following their loss in the war (Hutchinson, 2011). He is a controversial historical figure because of his participation in both Indigenous and European cultures. He is sometimes seen as an assimilationist and sometimes as a forward thinker (Sugden, 2012, p. 131). His legacy has been interpreted in various ways.

## DIGITIZING A STATUE OF JOSEPH BRANT

To translate Brant into the digital world, I created a 3D digital model of the statue of Brant from the Valiants Memorial in downtown Ottawa (Moore and McEwen, 2006). This recreation of the statue of Brant as a digital model is a form of digital mimesis. Tara Copplestone and Daniel Dunne define digital mimeses as “a situation in which the digital media form mimics the conventions and structures of the print or analogue media that preceded it” or, in this case, the art form that preceded it (2017). The digitization of this statue maintains the art form of the statue and how it represents Brant. It does not create a new narrative about Brant. The digital model is more so a preservation of the statue than a subversion or modification of its meaning. 

My translation of the statue of Brant into a digital model is a type of preservation. The statue ensures the continued remembrance of Brant by commemorating the man and propagating what he represents, and the digital model preserves this statue on a different platform. Should anything happen to the physical statue, the digital statue will still be online. However, as Paul Reilly cautions, technology also has limits to its lifespan: “code ages and dies; machines break down and become defunct”; and new technologies are created to replace the old (2015, p. 11). Anything saved on floppy discs, for example, has become more difficult to access since floppy discs have gone out of fashion. The 3D model of Brant will preserve the statue online until the website on which it is saved – Sketchfab – no longer works or is no longer accessible. 

Reilly’s model of the process of assembly and disassembly can show how the statue preserves Brant. Reilly expands on Gavin Lucas’s formation theory to suggest that four relational characteristics – fleeting, unfolding, enduring and seeping – can define the archaeological processes of assembly and disassembly (2015, p. 7). These characteristics relate to the transience and the permeability of an object. *Figure 1*, from Reilly’s article “Palimpsests of Immaterial Assemblages Taken out of Context”, depicts the characterization of the victims of Vesuvius in CE 79 and the subsequent models made out of the voids their bodies left in the hardened rock (2015, p. 10). Brant, like the victims of Vesuvius, had a permeable body with an average lifespan and an unfolding existence. After he died, his existence became fleeting and his body became increasingly permeable. His statue is not physically connected with Brant’s physical body, but it moves collective memory of him to a more impermeable and enduring state. The digital model of Brant is more seeping than enduring because it is easier to modify. However, it is also more persistent that the physical statue. The ease of replicating and modifying the digital model makes it susceptible to recontextualization, reconfiguration and reconceptualization, which extends the model’s use and career (Reilly, 2015, p. 11). Although the physical statue preserves the memory of Brant, the digitization of the statue increases the persistence of that memory.

*Figure 1: “Mapping the extended Pompeian assemblage due to the fourth pyroclastic surge to the ‘persistency versus permeability’ grid of forces framework” (Reilly, 2015, p.7).*

The digitization of the statue also broadens its audience from those who visit downtown Ottawa to anyone who has access to the internet. Digitization allows the statue to “meet the behold halfway” online, instead of the beholder having to physically go to see the statue (Walter, 1968, p. 4). Digitizing the statue extends the lifespan and the audience of the statue’s representation of Brant. 


## REMIXING BRANT TO CREATE A NEW NARRATIVE

For the second module of the course, I remixed the 3D digital model of the statue of Brant to create a new model with a different narrative about whom Brant was. Digitization of history makes these digital objects easier to manipulate and change. I combined the body of Geoffrey Marchal’s digital model, A Bishop Saint – which was modelled from a statue in the National Gallery of Denmark – with the head of the digital model of Brant (Marchal, 2015). The outcome was the 3D model *Bishop Brant,* which emphasized Brant’s relationship with the Christian Church. This model creates a new narrative about Brant in which he was greatly influenced by European culture and Christian religion. The remixed model emphasizes the importance of Christianity on his legacy. 

This remix of Brant is a subversion of traditional narratives about Brant and his legacy. I do not mean to interpret the role of Christianity on his legacy as a positive or negative influence, nor do I wish to authoritatively state that religion should be emphasized when representing Brant. I wish to draw attention to the various ways by which one can interpret Brant. David J. Gunkel describes mash-ups – or remixes – as “subversions of authority” (2008, p. 490). Through this model, I mean to challenge the idea of an objective and authoritative historical narrative. What we choose to emphasize, omit and include in our representation of history is based how we understand the world as individuals. Historical narratives may be presented as objective and factual narratives, but they are contingent on the present and on the subjectivity of individuals. For example, there has been some speculation as to whether or not Brant was half-white (Muir, 1977, p. 3). This speculation was based on the idea that Brant’s relationship with the British and his “sophistication” would only be possible if he was not wholly Indigenous. The justification for this speculation was based on the bias of white people in which they are the norm and people of colour are inferior. History consists of evolving narratives that must continually be challenged. Digitization can both help to create narratives that need to be challenged and help to challenge these narratives. 

It must also be noted that while manipulating the traditional narrative about Brant, I have also subverted Brant’s self-representation. Brant had purposefully manipulated his self-representation to appeal to both Indigenous people and Europeans (Hutchinson, 2011, p. 2013). He is most often depicted in Indian dress, which is “a mixture of articles of English and Native origin that was the conventional costume of Native-Anglo trade and diplomacy in the eighteenth century” (Hutchinson, 2011, p. 209). Brant presented himself in a way that demonstrated his indigeneity while stating his role as an interpreter of cultures. However, I have white-washed Brant by combining his likeness to that of an anonymous white bishop. Digitizing history allows for new ways to represent history, but one should consider critically why this new narrative has been created and whom it benefits. Digitization provides opportunities to creatively represent history, which can both benefit and disadvantage historians and the people being represented.

	
## EXPLORING REPRESENTATIONS OF BRANT IN A VIRTUAL GAME

The goal of the third project in *Critical Making in Digital History* was to translate history into a digital world. I did this by creating a text-based game, using Twine, in which the audience plays as an intern at a museum whose must decide how to represent Brant for an exhibition. The game is called *Who is he? Joseph Brant / Thayendanegea.* Some of the decisions that the player must make include: whether to identify him as Joseph Brant or Thayendanegea; whether to emphasize his role as a warrior, his role as a statesman or his relationship with the Church; and whether to emphasize his intentions or the outcomes of his actions. The purpose of this game is to have the players recognize the subjectivity of historical narratives and the various ways that Brant can be represented. Knowledge is not static, and it is important to understand the biases present in history. Translating Brant into a game allows the for a more dynamic understanding of Brant.  

*Who is he? Joseph Brant / Thayendanegea* is a form of active multilinear narrative. Copplestone and Dunne define an active multilinear narrative as “a structure in which the audience makes decisions that subsequently determine the direction in which a story can unfold and potentially the ultimate ending” (2017). Active multilinear narratives allow the audience to actively engage with the narrative and direct the narrative down a network of routes (Copplestone and Dunne 2017). Active multilinear narratives allow the audience to explore the whys, the hows, and the what ifs of history. *Who is he? Joseph Brant / Thayendanegea* allows the audience to explore how different representations of Brant are created. The audience directs the focus and the language of a brief biography of Brant’s life. This style of narrative relies on digital media to more easily structure the network work of paths it requires. However, active multilinear narratives can also be found in Choose Your Own Adventure books wherein the reader flips to different pages within the book to direct different narratives depending on the choices they make and the pages to which they flip. Nevertheless, the digitization of these narratives allows for a more creative approach to this structure as pictures, 3D models and other creative features can be added. Active multilinear narratives challenge traditional, authoritative narratives and allow the audience to gain a deeper understanding of history and how it is represented. The digitization of history creates opportunities for people to not only create new narratives but to utilize new narrative structures. 


## RETURNING BRANT INTO THE PHYSICAL WORLD

The final project for the course was to return the digital objects back into the physical world, either through an augmented reality platform or by 3D printing the object. I chose to use the augmented reality platform HP Reveal. I intended to bring my 3D digital model of the statue of Brant from the first project into the physical world through HP Reveal, but the quality of the model in the augmented reality was not sufficient for this project. Therefore, I stuck with my original idea of exploring texts relating to Brant and overlaying commentary in the augmented reality, but without the inclusion of a 3D digital model. My goal in this project was to address certain misconceptions about Brant. Brant, for example, was not a Mohawk chief, although he did have a lot of political influence (Sugden, 1996). My augmented reality experience ended up being more of an experiment to show that augmented reality can be used to represent history than a good example of how augmented reality can be used to represent history.

Augmented reality can be used to represent history in ways other than criticizing texts. Augmented reality, for example, can be used to show historical sites and architecture that have deteriorated over time or that cannot fit within a museum. Derya Güleç Özer, Takehiko Nagakura and Nikolaos Vlavianos suggest that meaning, data and appearances would be lost were a historical site to be resituated and accommodated in a museum (2016, p. 186). It is also difficult to understand historical ruins without knowing how the ruins looked prior to their deterioration (Özer, Nagakura and Vlavianos, 2016, p. 186). However, 3D visualization – that augmented reality can provide – can depict the context of the site and its original appearance. In their article “Augmented reality (AR) of historic environments”, Özer, Nagakura and Vlavianos explain how viewers can view a model of the Parion Theater on their phone through an app while circling a part of the theater in Biga, Turkey (2016, p. 191). They use augmented reality to contextualize and represent history in connection with the artefacts that one is seeing. Augmented reality can be used to reconstruct historical artefacts and sites and to present these reconstructions to the public.


## CONCLUSION

Digitization can allow for a more complex and interactive understanding of history. Digitization can allow us to preserve history and to create new historical narratives and representations. Claudio Fogu and Edward L. Ayers perhaps best describe the relationship between history and digital media when the former writes 
> As Edward L. Ayers puts it, ‘history may be better suited to digital technology than any other humanistic discipline.’ This is so, in the first place, because ‘the hypertextuality of digital texts allows for a multiplicity of semantic connections among data,’ and hence the opportunity to ‘move toward more complex forms of analysis,’ but also because it offers innovative ways to reconfigure narrative along nonlinear paths 
> (Fogu, 2009, p.107).

In other words, the digitization of history creates opportunities for history to be explored through nonlinear and non-traditional ways. There are many ways in which digital media can analyze and represent history and there will continue to be more ways as technology evolves and people continue to creatively explore how those technologies can be used.
